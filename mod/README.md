## The code contained here is _only_ my additions, it is not the full decompiled source of the game. There is a patch file which can patch the game's decompiled source (you have to decompile it yourself, I cannot redistribute the decompiled source), and a program you can run which puts my additions into files that you can read a little more easily.

## I belive in good faith that this is _not_ a derivitive work, because it contains only my additions.
